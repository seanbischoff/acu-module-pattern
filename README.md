================

This version of the alertConfirmUtil uses the Module Pattern in order to facilitate "private" properties and methods using closures.

Wrapped around the jQuery-UI Dialog, this module provides custom versions of a confirm dialog, and alerts with 4 different states - Default, Error, Success, and Warning.

TODO: Think of a catchy name.
